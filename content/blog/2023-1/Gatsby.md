Gatsby `Link`

> The Gatsby `Link` component provides a performance feature called **preloading**. This means that the resources for the linked page are requested when the link scrolls into view or when the mouse hovers on it. That way, when the user actually clicks on the link, the new page can load super quickly.

> Conveniently, Gatsby has a powerful feature called the **data layer** that you can use to pull data into your site from anywhere. Want to keep your blog posts in WordPress, your store products in Shopify, and your user data in Airtable? No problem! With Gatsby’s data layer, you can combine data from multiple sources, which lets you choose the best platform for each type of data.
